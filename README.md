# 9CT-APIs
This is extension for Year 9 Computing Technology students completing a data science unit. Having already learned how to use Pandas and Matplotlib modules, students who wish to extend themselves are encouraged to make use of APIs for their project instead of just using .csv files.

I will add websites and sample programs here as I find them in order to provide real-world opportunities for extension.

## weather api test.py 
This uses a [BOM Forecast API](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs/bom-api) in order to detect recent Gosford weather information. It is the same as the sample program and requires no user keys to pull the information and is entirely free **_for non profit use (including educational)_**. The only changes I have made is to use the latitude and longitude of Gosford.
